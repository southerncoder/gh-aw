## What are GitHub Agentic Workflows?

GitHub Agentic Workflows allow you to write repository-level AI agent descriptions in plain markdown and run automatically in GitHub Actions. Describe your repository automation goals and execute safely with built-in security controls, having AI make intelligent decisions based on context.

**How they work:**
1. **Write** - Create a `.md` file with your automation instructions in natural language
2. **Compile** - Run `gh aw compile` to transform it into a secure GitHub Actions workflow (`.lock.yml`)
3. **Run** - GitHub Actions executes your workflow automatically based on your triggers

> [!WARNING]
> GitHub Agentic Workflows is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

### Security Built-In

Workflows run with read-only permissions by default. Write operations require explicit approval through sanitized [safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#safe-outputs) (pre-approved GitHub operations), with sandboxed execution, tool allowlisting, and network isolation ensuring AI agents operate safely within controlled boundaries.

## Example: Daily Issues Report

Here's a simple workflow that runs daily to create an upbeat status report:

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule: daily
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[team-status] "
    labels: [report, daily-status]
    close-older-issues: true
---

## Daily Issues Report

Create an upbeat daily status report for the team as a GitHub issue.
```

The `gh aw` cli converts this into a GitHub Actions Workflow (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Copilot, Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment on a schedule or manually.

The AI agent reads your repository context, analyzes issues, generates visualizations, and creates reports - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.
