## What are Agentic Campaigns?

Agentic Campaigns are workflows that coordinate autonomous agents across one or more repositories to drive progress toward a shared goal and make that progress easy to track.

They run on a schedule and use:
- `imports` to include standard campaign orchestration from `shared/campaign.md`
- `project` to optionally track work with automatic [GitHub Projects](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2) integration

## Quick Start

Add `project` and `imports` to your workflow frontmatter:

```yaml wrap
---
name: Dependabot Burner
on:
  schedule: daily
  workflow_dispatch:

imports:
  - shared/campaign.md
---

# Dependabot Burner

- Project URL: https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/1
- Campaign ID: dependabot-burner

Find all open Dependabot PRs and add them to the project.
```

The `imports: [shared/campaign.md]` includes standard campaign orchestration rules and safe-output defaults.

## Campaign Orchestration Pattern

The `shared/campaign.md` import provides:

- **Safe-output defaults** - Pre-configured limits for project updates, issues, and status updates
- **Orchestration rules** - Best practices for discovery, deterministic execution, and reporting
- **Project integration** - Standard patterns for tracking work in GitHub Projects

## When to Use Campaigns

Use the campaign pattern when you need:

- **Coordinated work** - Manage related tasks across multiple repositories
- **Progress visibility** - Track all work items in a central project board
- **Systematic execution** - Discover, process, and update work items on a schedule
- **Team coordination** - Share progress with stakeholders through project updates

**Don't need orchestration?** A simple workflow without `imports` is simpler if you just need basic project tracking.

## Example: Dependabot Burner

The [Dependabot Burner workflow](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/dependabot-burner.md) demonstrates the campaign pattern:

```yaml
---
name: Dependabot Burner
on:
  schedule: daily
  skip-if-no-match: 'is:pr is:open author:app/dependabot'
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read

imports:
  - shared/campaign.md
---

# Dependabot Burner

- Project URL: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144
- Campaign ID: dependabot-burner

- Find all open Dependabot PRs and add them to the project.
- Create bundle issues for each runtime + manifest file.
- Add bundle issues to the project and assign to Copilot.
```

Key features:
- **Imports orchestration** - Uses `shared/campaign.md` for standard rules
- **Scheduled execution** - Runs daily to process new Dependabot PRs
- **Smart discovery** - Only runs if matching PRs exist (`skip-if-no-match`)
- **Project tracking** - Adds discovered items to GitHub Projects board
