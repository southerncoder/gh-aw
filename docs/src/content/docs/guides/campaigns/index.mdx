## What are Agentic Campaigns?

Agentic Campaigns are workflows that coordinate work across one or more repositories to drive progress toward a shared goal and make that progress easy to track.

They run on a schedule and include:
- **Natural language coordination** with defaults being imported from `shared/campaign.md`
- **Progress tracking** with optional automatic [GitHub Projects](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2)

## When should this just be a workflow?

**Rule of thumb:** If you're not tracking work items in a GitHub Project or coordinating multiple agents, you probably just need a regular workflow.

## How it works

The `shared/campaign.md` import provides:

- **Safe-output defaults** - Pre-configured limits for project updates, issues, and status updates
- **Coordination rules** - Best practices for discovery, deterministic execution, and reporting
- **Project integration** - Standard patterns for tracking work in GitHub Projects

## Getting Started
