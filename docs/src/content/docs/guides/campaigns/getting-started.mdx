## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Repository with GitHub Agentic Workflows installed
- GitHub Actions enabled
- (Optional) GitHub Projects V2 board for tracking campaign progress


**Create a campaign workflow:**

1. **Create a new workflow file** at `.github/workflows/my-campaign.md`:

```yaml wrap
---
name: My Campaign
on:
  schedule: daily
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read

imports:
  - shared/campaign.md
---

# My Campaign

Your campaign instructions here...
```

2. **Set up authentication**:

   - For project access:
     ```bash
     gh aw secrets set GH_AW_PROJECT_GITHUB_TOKEN --value "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN"
     ```
     See [GitHub Projects V2 Tokens](/gh-aw/reference/tokens/#gh_aw_project_github_token-github-projects-v2) for token setup.

   - For assigning work to Copilot (if your campaign uses `assignees: copilot` or `assign-to-agent` safe outputs):
     ```bash
     gh aw secrets set GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN --value "YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN"
     ```
     See [Agent Assignment Tokens](/gh-aw/reference/tokens/#gh_aw_agent_token-agent-assignment) for token setup.

3. **Compile and deploy**:

```bash
gh aw compile
git add .github/workflows/my-campaign.md .github/workflows/my-campaign.lock.yml
git commit -m "Add my campaign workflow"
git push
```

The `imports: [shared/campaign.md]` includes standard agent coordination rules and safe-output defaults.

## Example: Dependabot Burner

The [Dependabot Burner workflow](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/dependabot-burner.md) is a small but useful campaign - it demonstrates the essential campaign pattern with minimal complexity:

```yaml
---
name: Dependabot Burner
on:
  schedule: daily
  skip-if-no-match: 'is:pr is:open author:app/dependabot'
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read

imports:
  - shared/campaign.md

project: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144
---
# Dependabot Burner

- Find all open Dependabot PRs and add them to the project.
- Create bundle issues for each runtime + manifest file.
- Add bundle issues to the project and assign to Copilot.
```

Key features:
- **Imports orchestration** - Uses `shared/campaign.md` for standard rules
- **Scheduled execution** - Runs daily to process new Dependabot PRs
- **Smart discovery** - Only runs if matching PRs exist (`skip-if-no-match`)
- **Project tracking** - Adds discovered items to GitHub Projects board

## How it works

The campaign workflow:

1. Imports standard agent coordination rules from `shared/campaign.md`
2. Runs on schedule to discover work items
3. Processes items according to your instructions
4. Updates the GitHub Project board with progress
5. Reports status via project status updates
