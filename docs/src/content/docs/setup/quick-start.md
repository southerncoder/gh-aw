## Adding an Automated Daily Status Workflow to Your Repo

In this guide you will add the automated [**Daily Repo Status Report**](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-repo-status.md?plain=1) to an existing GitHub repository where you are a maintainer, running in GitHub Actions.

Remember the aim here is _automated AI_: to install something that will run _automatically_ every day, in the context of your repository, and create a fresh status report issue in your repository without any further manual intervention. If you're familiar with GitHub Actions, you will be aware of the power of automation.

There are hundreds of other ways to use GitHub Agentic Workflows, which you can explore in [Peli's Agent Factory](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/). This workflow is just the start of what's possible.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have:

- ✅ **AI Account** - A [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription, or a [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/api/) API key
- ✅ **GitHub Repository** - a GitHub repository you are maintainer on
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** enabled in your repository
- ✅ **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) - A command-line tool for GitHub. [Install here](https://cli.github.com) v2.0.0+
- ✅ **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL

### Step 1 — Install the extension

Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), then install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

```bash wrap
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're working in a GitHub Codespace, use the standalone installer instead:
>
> ```bash wrap
> curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
> ```

### Step 2 — Add the sample workflow and trigger a run

From your repository root run:

```bash wrap
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/daily-repo-status
```

This will take you through an interactive process to:

1. **Select an AI Engine** - You'll be prompted to choose between Claude, Copilot, or Codex
2. **Add the workflow** - Configure your first agentic workflow and set up required secrets
3. **Trigger an initial run** - Start the workflow immediately to see it in action

> [!TIP]
> Select your preferred coding agent when prompted and follow the setup instructions.

Once your initial run is complete, a new issue will be created in your repository with a "repo status report". The report will be automatically generated by the AI based on recent activity in your repository, including issues, PRs, discussions, releases, and code changes. It will analyze:

- Recent repository activity (issues, PRs, discussions, releases, code changes)
- Progress tracking, goal reminders and highlights
- Project status and recommendations
- Actionable next steps for maintainers

### Going further — Customize your workflow

The report is fully customizable. If you like, you can now customize the workflow by editing the workflow markdown file located at `.github/workflows/daily-repo-status.md` in your repository. You then run

```bash
gh aw compile
```

to regenerate the workflow YAML file `.github/workflows/daily-repo-status.lock.yml`, then push to your repository. You can then trigger another run by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-repo-status
```

or by using the GitHub UX.

Some ideas for customization:

- Adjust the schedule to run more or less frequently
- Modify the style or content of the report
- Add additional data sources or metrics to analyze
- Focus in on specific areas of your repository or project
- Adjust the instructions to analyze patterns in failed CI runs or test coverage
- Request analysis of compliance with organizational standards
- Request analysis of spam or inappropriate content in issues or PRs
- Request analysis of ways the repository could be modernized or simplified
- And much more!

Alternatively, you can browse some of the sample workflows in [Peli's Agent Factory](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/) and add them to your repository using `gh aw add <workflow-spec>`, or remix them to create your own workflows.

## What's next?

With that, you are up and running with your first automated agentic workflow!
