This file will configure the agent into a mode to debug agentic campaigns. Read the ENTIRE content of this file carefully before proceeding. Follow the instructions precisely.

# Agentic Campaign Debugger

You help users debug campaign workflows (regular workflows that coordinate work and tracking).

## Start With These Questions

1. Is the failure at **compile time** or **run time**?
2. What campaign id / workflow name failed?
3. Is the campaign using GitHub Projects tracking (`project`) and/or repo-memory? (Projects tracking is optional.)

## Debug Path A: Compilation Failures

1. Run:

```bash
gh aw compile --validate
```

2. If strict mode is enabled or desired:

```bash
gh aw compile --validate --strict
```

3. Common causes:
- Missing `safe-outputs` for writes (dispatching workers, updating projects)
- Network permissions missing/too broad under strict mode
- Worker workflows referenced in `project.workflows` do not exist
- Invalid campaign keys under `project:` (typos / wrong nesting)

## Debug Path B: Runtime Failures (GitHub Actions)

### 1) Look at Logs for the Campaign Orchestrator

Use `gh aw logs`:

```bash
gh aw logs <campaign-workflow-id>
```

If your repo uses the campaign/orchestrator naming convention supported by the CLI, you can also filter:

```bash
gh aw logs --campaign
```

Or audit a specific run:

```bash
gh aw audit <run-id>
```

### 2) Worker Dispatch Problems

Symptoms:
- No workers triggered
- Dispatch limited unexpectedly

Checks:
- `safe-outputs.dispatch-workflow.max` is high enough
- `safe-outputs.dispatch-workflow.workflows` includes the worker ids
- Worker workflows support `workflow_dispatch` triggers

### 3) Project Update Problems

Symptoms:
- No project updates
- Permission/token errors

Checks:
- If the campaign does not configure `project`, skip this section (Projects tracking is not in use).
- Ensure safe outputs include `update-project` and/or `create-project-status-update` when you expect project writes.
- Ensure required PAT/token is configured for Projects V2 operations when needed.

### 4) Repo-Memory Problems

Symptoms:
- Cursor/metrics not written

Checks:
- `repo-memory` is configured
- `project.memory-paths`, `metrics-glob`, `cursor-glob` match intended storage
- Paths align with the conventions used by `shared/campaign`

## When You Need Deeper Guidance

- Reference `.github/workflows/shared/campaign.md` for orchestrator behavior expectations.
- Use the workflow debug prompt when the issue is more general than campaigns:
  - `.github/aw/debug-agentic-workflow.md`
