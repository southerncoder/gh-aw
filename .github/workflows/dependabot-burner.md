# Dependabot Burner

{{#runtime-import aw/campaign.md}}

## Config

- Project URL: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144
- Campaign ID: dependabot-burner
- Target repo: githubnext/gh-aw

## Task

### Discover work items

Find open Dependabot PRs in `githubnext/gh-aw`:
```
repo:githubnext/gh-aw is:pr author:app/dependabot label:dependencies label:javascript is:open
```

Follow `aw/campaign.md` (Budgets & Pacing) for limits and ordering.
If no PRs are found, follow `aw/campaign.md` (No-Work Default).

### Update project items

For each discovered PR, call `update_project` with:
- `project`: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144
- `content_type`: "pull_request"
- `content_number`: the PR number
- `fields`: follow the defaults in `aw/campaign.md`
  - Override for this workflow: `worker_workflow`: "dependabot"

### Bundle dependabot PRs into issues

Create up to 3 bundle issues, each representing exactly **one runtime + one manifest file** (never mix runtimes; never mix manifests).

For each bundle:

1. Call `create_issue(...)` with a title like:
   - `[dependabot-burner] Dependabot bundle — <runtime> — <manifest> (YYYY-MM-DD)`
   Issue body should include:
   - Runtime + manifest
   - Checklist of PRs in the bundle
   - A short research section (breaking changes / migration notes / risk)

2. Capture the returned temporary ID, then immediately call `update_project(...)` to add that issue to the project:
   - `project`: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144
   - `content_type`: "issue"
   - `content_number`: "<temporary_id>"
   - `fields`: follow the defaults in `aw/campaign.md` (Project Field Defaults)
     - Set `status`: "In Progress" (since the issue represents active work)
     - Set `campaign_id`: "dependabot-burner"
     - Set `target_repo`: "githubnext/gh-aw"
     - Set `worker_workflow`: "dependabot"

### Final step

After all work is complete, call `create_project_status_update` exactly once as required by `aw/campaign.md` (Project Status Updates):
- `project`: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144
- `status`: "ON_TRACK" (or "INACTIVE" if no work was found)
- `start_date`: today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `body`: Include:
  - Discovery query used
  - Counts: number of PRs found, issues created, project items updated
  - Next steps or summary of work completed
