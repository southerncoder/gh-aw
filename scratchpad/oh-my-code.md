## 2. Use Case Alignment

### 2.1 oh-my-opencode: Local Development Acceleration

**Ideal Scenarios**:

1. **Large-scale refactoring**: Use LSP and AST-Grep to rename symbols, restructure code, migrate APIs across 100+ files
2. **Multi-component development**: Frontend agent works on UI while backend agent implements API simultaneously
3. **Deep code exploration**: Librarian agent searches official docs, codebase history, and GitHub implementations
4. **Interactive debugging**: Oracle agent provides design feedback and debugging assistance in real-time
5. **Code implementation**: Todo Continuation Enforcer ensures tasks complete; Comment Checker prevents unnecessary comments

**Example Workflow**:
```
User: "ultrawork - Implement OAuth authentication system"

1. Sisyphus (Main): Creates implementation plan
2. Librarian (Background): Researches OAuth best practices, finds implementations
3. Frontend Engineer (Background): Implements login UI
4. Sisyphus (Main): Implements backend OAuth flow
5. Oracle (Consultation): Reviews security implications
6. Explore (Search): Finds similar patterns in codebase
7. Sisyphus (Main): Integrates all components, runs tests
8. Todo Enforcer: Ensures all subtasks complete before stopping
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Multiple agents work in parallel
- Context management handled automatically
- IDE-integrated tools (LSP) available to agents
- Agents continue until task completion
- Code follows project conventions

### 2.2 GitHub Agentic Workflows: Repository Automation

**Ideal Scenarios**:

1. **Issue triage**: Auto-label, prioritize, and respond to new issues
2. **PR automation**: Review code, check security, validate tests, create reviews
3. **Scheduled reports**: Daily/weekly repository health, metrics, trend analysis
4. **Documentation sync**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
5. **Security monitoring**: Scan for vulnerabilities, create issues for findings
6. **Release management**: Generate changelogs, create releases, notify teams

**Example Workflow**:
```yaml
---
description: PR Review and Security Check
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [repos, pull_requests]
safe-outputs:
  create-review:
  create-issue:
strict: true
---

# PR Security Review

Review PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

1. Analyze code changes for security issues
2. Check for secret leaks, SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities
3. Create review with findings
4. If critical issues found, create blocking issue

Use GitHub MCP to access PR files and repository context.
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Runs automatically on GitHub events
- Sandboxed, secure execution
- Supports multi-user repository automation
- Audit trail via GitHub Actions logs
- Integration with Issues, PRs, Discussions

---

## 3. Multi-Agent Coordination

### 3.1 oh-my-opencode: Native Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Architecture**: Main agent + specialized background agents

**Agent Roster**:
| Agent | Model | Role | Execution Mode |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Sisyphus** | Claude Opus 4.5 High | Main implementation, coordination | Foreground |
| **Oracle** | GPT 5.2 Medium | Design, debugging, problem-solving | On-demand |
| **Frontend Engineer** | Gemini 3 Pro | UI/UX implementation | Background |
| **Librarian** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Documentation research, codebase exploration | Background |
| **Explore** | Grok Code | Fast codebase grep/search | Background |

**Coordination Mechanisms**:

1. **Background Execution**: Agents run asynchronously while main agent works
   ```typescript
   // Sisyphus delegates to background agent
   await backgroundAgent('frontend-ui-ux-engineer', {
     task: 'Implement login form UI',
     context: currentFiles,
     notify: true
   });
   // Main agent continues working on backend
   ```

2. **Agent Delegation**: Main agent can call specialized agents for expertise
   ```typescript
   // Ask Oracle for design advice
   const advice = await callAgent('oracle', 'How should I structure this authentication flow?');
   ```

3. **Context Sharing**: Agents share workspace, files, and project context automatically

4. **Hook-Based Communication**: Agents communicate via lifecycle hooks
   - `PreToolUse`: Inject context before tool execution
   - `PostToolUse`: Process results after tool execution
   - `UserPromptSubmit`: Enhance prompts with shared knowledge

**Todo Continuation Enforcer**: Critical feature that prevents agents from quitting halfway
- Monitors agent progress
- Forces continuation if todos remain incomplete
- Ensures work completes before session ends
- "This is what keeps Sisyphus rolling that boulder"

**Benefits**:
- Parallel execution across multiple agents
- Specialized expertise (design, frontend, backend, research)
- Context management handled automatically
- Agent coordination and delegation

### 3.2 GitHub Agentic Workflows: Event-Driven Single-Agent

**Architecture**: One agent per workflow run, coordination via GitHub events

**Coordination Pattern**:
```
Workflow 1 (Issue Responder)
  ↓ Creates Issue
Workflow 2 (Issue Analyzer)
  ↓ Labels Issue
Workflow 3 (Task Assigner)
  ↓ Updates Issue
Workflow 4 (Progress Tracker)
  ↓ Creates Report
```

**Example Multi-Workflow Coordination**:

```yaml
# workflow-1-creator.md
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
safe-outputs:
  update-issue:
    labels: ["needs-analysis"]

# workflow-2-analyzer.md
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
safe-outputs:
  update-issue:
    labels: ["high-priority"]

# workflow-3-tracker.md
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'
safe-outputs:
  create-discussion:
```

**Limitations of Current Model**:
- No direct workflow-to-workflow communication
- No shared state between workflows
- No centralized orchestration
- Difficult to track multi-workflow campaigns

**Potential Future Enhancement**: Campaign Orchestrator Pattern (inspired by Gastown)

```markdown
# campaign-orchestrator.md
---
on: workflow_dispatch
inputs:
  campaign_id: string
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, workflows]
safe-outputs:
  dispatch-workflow:
  update-issue:
---

## Campaign Orchestrator

Coordinate multiple worker workflows:

1. Find issues with label `campaign:{{ inputs.campaign_id }}`
2. Create worker issues for each task
3. Dispatch worker workflows with assignments
4. Monitor progress (poll every 5 minutes)
5. Detect blockers (no progress in 30+ minutes)
6. Escalate to team when needed
7. Create completion report
```

**Benefits of Event-Driven Model**:
- Security: Each workflow runs independently with explicit permissions
- Auditability: Clear trail of which workflow did what
- Simplicity: No complex coordination protocol
- GitHub-native: Uses Issues/PRs as communication medium

```typescript
// Find all API calls matching pattern
astgrep_search({
  pattern: "fetch($URL, { method: 'POST', body: $BODY })",
  language: "typescript"
});

// Replace all with new API
astgrep_replace({
  from: "fetch($URL, { method: 'POST', body: $BODY })",

- Screenshot/PDF generation

#### Category 4: Safe Outputs (GitHub API Write Operations)
Sanitized write operations to GitHub:

| Safe Output | Purpose | Validation |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| `create-issue` | Create GitHub issue | Title/body sanitization, XSS prevention |
| `update-issue` | Update existing issue | Field validation, authorization check |
| `create-pull-request` | Create PR | Branch validation, conflict detection |
| `create-discussion` | Create discussion | Category validation, content sanitization |
| `add-comment` | Add comment | Context validation, mention safety |
| `create-review` | Create PR review | Review state validation, comment safety |

**Security Model**: AI runs with read-only permissions; write operations in separate validated jobs

**Key Advantage**: Secure-by-default with automatic sanitization and validation

---

## 5. Security Models

### 5.1 oh-my-opencode: User-Managed Security

**Philosophy**: Developer-local environment with user control

**Security Characteristics**:

| Aspect | Implementation | Risk Level |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Execution Environment** | Local user machine | User-managed |
| **Permissions** | Full user permissions (filesystem, network) | User-controlled environment |
| **Network Access** | Unrestricted (can access any URL) | User-controlled |
| **Code Execution** | Direct shell command execution | User-trusted |
| **State Management** | Persistent sessions, file modifications | User-reviewed |
| **MCP Servers** | User-installed, local execution | User-vetted |

**Trust Model**: 
- User trusts the AI agents they configure
- User reviews code changes before committing
- Local execution = local consequences
- No sandboxing (full system access)

**Safety Features**:
1. **Comment Checker**: Prevents excessive AI-generated comments (code should look human-written)
2. **Todo Continuation Enforcer**: Ensures complete work (prevents half-finished changes)
3. **Hook System**: Allows custom security checks via `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse` hooks
4. **Agent Specialization**: Limits blast radius (Frontend agent doesn't touch backend)

**Best Practices**:
- Review agent output before committing
- Use version control (git) for rollback
- Configure agents with appropriate model choices
- Test in safe environments first

**Risk Profile**: **High trust, high power** - Suitable for experienced developers who want maximum agent capabilities

### 5.2 GitHub Agentic Workflows: Defense-in-Depth

**Philosophy**: Secure-by-default, zero-trust model

**Security Layers**:

```
Layer 1: Compile-Time Validation
  ├── Schema validation (frontmatter correctness)
  ├── Permission validation (no excessive permissions)
  ├── Expression sanitization (prevent injection)
  ├── Tool allowlist enforcement
  └── Supply chain checks (SHA-pinned actions)

Layer 2: Sandboxed Execution
  ├── Isolated GitHub Actions container
  ├── Read-only filesystem (except /tmp)
  ├── Network firewall (domain allowlist)
  └── Limited token scope

Layer 3: Safe Outputs
  ├── Read/write separation (agent reads, job writes)
  ├── Content sanitization (XSS, injection prevention)
  ├── Validation checks (schema, permissions)
  └── Threat detection (AI-powered scanning)

Layer 4: Runtime Monitoring
  ├── Workflow logs (full audit trail)
  ├── Cost monitoring (token usage tracking)
  ├── Timeout enforcement (max 6 hours)
  └── Human approval gates (critical operations)
```

**Strict Mode Enforcement**:
```yaml
strict: true
permissions:
  contents: read    # Read-only default
network:
  allowed: [defaults]  # Secure network defaults
```

**Strict mode enforces**:
1. Blocks write permissions (`contents:write`, `issues:write`) - use safe-outputs instead
2. Requires explicit network configuration (no unrestricted access)
3. Refuses wildcard `*` in network domains
4. Requires network config for custom MCP containers
5. Enforces action pinning to commit SHAs
6. Refuses deprecated frontmatter fields

**Threat Detection** (automatic with safe outputs):
```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
  threat-detection:
    enabled: true
    prompt: "Focus on SQL injection and secret leaks"
```

**Analysis includes**:
- Prompt injection attempts
- Secret leakage (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Malicious code patterns (SQL injection, XSS)
- Supply chain attacks (suspicious dependencies)

**Fork Protection**:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    forks: ["trusted-org/*"]  # Explicit fork allowlist
    # Default: blocks all forks
```

**Key Security Features**:

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Read-only default** | `permissions: contents: read` | AI cannot modify code |
| **Safe outputs** | Separate validation jobs | Write operations sanitized |
| **Network isolation** | Domain allowlist + firewall | Prevent data exfiltration |
| **Sandboxing** | GitHub Actions containers | Limited blast radius |
| **SHA pinning** | `actions/checkout@abc123...` | Supply chain security |
| **Expression limits** | Max 120 chars per expression | Prevent injection attacks |
| **Context sanitization** | `needs.activation.outputs.text` | Neutralized @mentions, safe XML |
| **Audit logging** | GitHub Actions logs | Full traceability |

**Risk Profile**: **Low trust, controlled power** - Suitable for team/org automation with strict security requirements

---

## 6. State Management and Persistence

### 6.1 oh-my-opencode: Stateful Sessions

**State Model**: Persistent across agent sessions

**Session Characteristics**:
- Workspace state preserved between invocations
- Agents can continue work across restarts
- Background agents maintain context
- Todo lists persist until complete

**Example Session Flow**:
```
Session 1 (Day 1, 9am):
  - User: "Implement authentication system"
  - Sisyphus: Creates plan, delegates frontend to background agent
  - User: Closes IDE for lunch

Session 2 (Day 1, 2pm):
  - User: Opens IDE
  - Sisyphus: Resumes from last checkpoint
  - Frontend agent: Reports UI complete
  - Sisyphus: Continues with backend integration

Session 3 (Day 2, 9am):
  - User: Opens IDE
  - Todo Enforcer: Detects incomplete tests
  - Sisyphus: Completes test suite
  - All todos complete → Session ends
```

**State Storage**:
- Workspace files (modified by agents)
- Agent context (conversation history)
- Todo tracking (incomplete tasks)
- Background agent status

**Benefits**:
- Long-running tasks span multiple sessions
- No work lost on interruption
- Agents pick up where they left off
- User controls when work is "done"

### 6.2 GitHub Agentic Workflows: Stateless Execution

**State Model**: Each workflow run is independent

**Run Characteristics**:
- Fresh environment for each run
- No state preserved between runs
- Each trigger creates new execution
- Timeout limit (max 6 hours per run)

**Example Workflow Sequence**:
```
Run 1 (PR opened):
  - Trigger: pull_request.opened
  - Agent: Reviews PR files
  - Output: Creates review comment
  - State: Discarded

Run 2 (PR updated):
  - Trigger: pull_request.synchronize
  - Agent: Reviews new changes (no memory of Run 1)
  - Output: Creates new review
  - State: Discarded

Run 3 (Daily report):
  - Trigger: schedule (cron)
  - Agent: Analyzes all PRs (including above)
  - Output: Creates discussion with metrics
  - State: Discarded
```

**State Communication** (via GitHub API):
- Issues: Track work items, progress
- PR comments: Record review history
- Discussions: Store reports, summaries
- Labels: Coordinate workflow handoffs
- Artifacts: Pass data between jobs (within run)

**Potential Future Enhancement**: Checkpoint/Resume Pattern

```yaml
# Long-running workflow with checkpoints
on: workflow_dispatch
inputs:
  checkpoint_id:
    description: 'Resume from checkpoint'
    required: false

# In workflow body:
# 1. Check for existing checkpoint (issue or artifact)
# 2. Load state if checkpoint exists
# 3. Execute only incomplete steps
# 4. Save checkpoint after each phase
# 5. On failure, next run resumes from last checkpoint
```

**Benefits of Stateless Model**:
- Predictable, reproducible runs
- Transparent behavior (no hidden state)
- Scales horizontally (parallel runs)
- Audit trail via GitHub Actions logs

**Trade-offs**:
- Must re-do work on failure
- Long workflows inefficient on retry
- No "memory" between runs

- **CPU**: Depends on agent count (2-5 agents typical)
- **Memory**: 2-8 GB (depends on language servers)
- **Network**: API calls to LLM providers (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- **Storage**: Local workspace + IDE state

**Performance Characteristics**:
| Metric | Typical Value | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Agent spawn time** | 1-3 seconds | Local process creation |
| **Tool execution** | 10-100ms | LSP, grep, file operations |
| **LLM response** | 2-10 seconds | Network latency to provider |
| **Background agents** | 2-5 parallel | Limited by user machine |
| **Session persistence** | Instant | Local state, no cold start |

**Scalability**:
- **Horizontal**: Run multiple OpenCode instances (different projects)
- **Vertical**: Higher-spec machine (more CPU/RAM) = more background agents
- **Cost**: Pay for LLM API usage only (no CI/CD minutes)

**Optimization Tips**:
- Use faster models for background agents (Gemini Flash)
- Use slower, smarter models for main agent (Opus 4.5)
- Cache context with Librarian agent
- Leverage LSP for instant code intelligence

### 9.2 GitHub Agentic Workflows: Cloud Scale

| **Warm start** | 10-20 seconds | Cached container |
| **Tool execution** | 100ms-2s | Network call to GitHub API/MCP |
| **LLM response** | 5-30 seconds | Copilot/Claude/Codex latency |
| **Max workflow time** | 6 hours | GitHub Actions limit |
| **Parallelism** | Unlimited | Multiple workflows run concurrently |

**Scalability**:
- **Horizontal**: Unlimited parallel workflows (GitHub manages)
- **Vertical**: Use higher-spec runners (self-hosted or GitHub)
- **Cost**: Pay for Actions minutes + LLM tokens

**Optimization Tips**:
- Use caching for dependencies (setup-node, setup-python)
- Enable concurrency limits to avoid rate limits
- Use workflow artifacts for data passing
- Set appropriate timeout-minutes (avoid wasted time)

**Cost Monitoring**:
```bash
# Track token usage and costs
gh aw logs --metrics

# Example output:
# Workflow: pr-reviewer
# Run: 123456
# Duration: 3m 45s
# Tokens: 15,234 (input: 12,000, output: 3,234)
# Cost: $0.15 (estimated)
```
