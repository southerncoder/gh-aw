# Contributing to GitHub Agentic Workflows

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GitHub Agentic Workflows! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to work with you.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project requires agentic development using GitHub Copilot Agent. No local development environment is needed or expected.**

## 🤖 Agentic Development Workflow

GitHub Agentic Workflows is developed **exclusively through GitHub Copilot Agent**. This means:

- ✅ **All development happens in pull requests** created by GitHub Copilot Agent
- ✅ **No local setup required** - agents handle building, testing, and validation
- ✅ **Automated quality assurance** - CI runs all checks on agent-created PRs
- ❌ **Local development is not supported** - all work is done through the agent

### Why Agentic Development?

This project practices what it preaches: agentic workflows are used to build agentic workflows. Benefits include:

- **Consistency**: All changes go through the same automated quality gates
- **Accessibility**: No need to set up local development environments
- **Best practices**: Agents follow established patterns and guidelines automatically
- **Dogfooding**: We use our own tools to build our tools

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Fork <https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/> to your GitHub account

### Step 2: Open an Issue or Discussion

- Describe what you want to contribute
- Explain the use case and expected behavior
- Provide examples if applicable
- Tag with appropriate labels (see [Label Guidelines](scratchpad/labels.md))

### Step 3: Create a Pull Request with GitHub Copilot Agent

Use GitHub Copilot Agent to implement your contribution:

1. **Start from the issue**: Reference the issue number in your PR description
2. **Provide clear instructions**: Tell the agent what changes you want
3. **Let the agent work**: The agent will read guidelines, make changes, run tests
4. **Review and iterate**: The agent will respond to feedback and update the PR

**Example PR description:**

```markdown
Fix #123 - Add support for custom MCP server timeout configuration

@github-copilot agent, please:
- Add a `timeout` field to MCP server configuration schema
- Update validation to accept timeout values between 5-300 seconds
- Add tests for timeout validation
- Update documentation with timeout examples
- Follow error message style guide for validation messages
```

### Step 4: Agent Handles Everything

The GitHub Copilot Agent will:

- Read relevant documentation and specifications
- Make code changes following established patterns
- Run `make agent-finish` to validate changes
- Format code, run linters, execute tests
- Recompile workflows to ensure compatibility
- Respond to review feedback and make adjustments

### No Local Setup Needed

You don't need to install Go, Node.js, or any dependencies. The agent runs in GitHub's infrastructure with all tools pre-configured.

## 📝 How to Contribute via GitHub Copilot Agent

All contributions are made through GitHub Copilot Agent in pull requests. The agent has access to comprehensive documentation and follows established patterns automatically.

### What the Agent Handles

The GitHub Copilot Agent automatically:

- **Reads specifications** from `scratchpad/`, `skills/`, and `.github/instructions/`
- **Follows code organization patterns** (see [scratchpad/code-organization.md](scratchpad/code-organization.md))
- **Implements validation** following the architecture in [scratchpad/validation-architecture.md](scratchpad/validation-architecture.md)
- **Uses console formatting** from `pkg/console` for CLI output
- **Writes error messages** following the [Error Message Style Guide](.github/instructions/error-messages.instructions.md)
- **Runs all quality checks**: `make agent-finish` (build, test, recompile, format, lint)
- **Updates documentation** for new features
- **Creates tests** for new functionality

### Reporting Issues

Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or request features:

- Include detailed steps to reproduce issues
- Explain the use case for feature requests
- Provide examples if applicable
- Follow [Label Guidelines](scratchpad/labels.md)
- The agent will read the issue and implement fixes in a PR

### Code Quality Standards

GitHub Copilot Agent automatically enforces:

#### Error Messages

All validation errors follow the template: **[what's wrong]. [what's expected]. [example]**

```go
// Agent produces error messages like this:
return fmt.Errorf("invalid time delta format: +%s. Expected format like +25h, +3d, +1w, +1mo. Example: +3d", deltaStr)
```

The agent runs `make lint-errors` to verify error message quality.

#### Console Output

The agent uses styled console functions from `pkg/console`:

```go
import "github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/pkg/console"

fmt.Println(console.FormatSuccessMessage("Operation completed"))
fmt.Println(console.FormatInfoMessage("Processing workflow..."))
fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, console.FormatErrorMessage(err.Error()))
```

#### File Organization

The agent follows these principles:

- **Prefer many small files** over large monolithic files
- **Group by functionality**, not by type
- **Use descriptive names** that clearly indicate purpose
- **Follow established patterns** from the codebase

**Key Patterns the Agent Uses**:

1. **Create Functions Pattern** - One file per GitHub entity creation
   - Examples: `create_issue.go`, `create_pull_request.go`, `create_discussion.go`

2. **Engine Separation Pattern** - Each engine has its own file
   - Examples: `copilot_engine.go`, `claude_engine.go`, `codex_engine.go`
   - Shared helpers in `engine_helpers.go`

3. **Focused Utilities Pattern** - Self-contained feature files
   - Examples: `expressions.go`, `strings.go`, `artifacts.go`

See [Code Organization Patterns](scratchpad/code-organization.md) for details.

#### Validation Patterns

The agent places validation logic appropriately:

**Centralized validation** (`pkg/workflow/validation.go`):

- Cross-cutting concerns
- Core workflow integrity
- GitHub Actions compatibility

**Domain-specific validation** (dedicated files):

- `strict_mode_validation.go` - Security enforcement
- `pip_validation.go` - Python packages
- `npm_validation.go` - NPM packages
- `docker_validation.go` - Docker images
- `expression_safety.go` - Expression security

See [Validation Architecture](scratchpad/validation-architecture.md) for the complete decision tree.

#### CLI Breaking Changes

The agent evaluates whether changes are breaking:

- **Breaking**: Removing/renaming commands or flags, changing JSON output structure, altering defaults
- **Non-breaking**: Adding new commands/flags, adding output fields, bug fixes

For breaking changes, the agent:

- Uses `major` changeset type
- Provides migration guidance
- Documents in CHANGELOG.md

See [Breaking CLI Rules](scratchpad/breaking-cli-rules.md) for details.

## 📋 Dependency License Policy

This project uses an MIT license and only accepts dependencies with compatible licenses.

### Allowed Licenses

The following open-source licenses are compatible with our MIT license:

- **MIT** - Most permissive, allows reuse with minimal restrictions
- **Apache-2.0** - Permissive license with patent grant
- **BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause** - Simple permissive licenses
- **ISC** - Simplified permissive license similar to MIT

### Disallowed Licenses

The following licenses are **not allowed** as they conflict with our MIT license or impose unacceptable restrictions:

- **GPL, LGPL, AGPL** - Copyleft licenses that would force us to release under GPL
- **SSPL** - Server Side Public License with restrictive requirements
- **Proprietary/Commercial** - Closed-source licenses requiring payment or special terms

### Before Adding a Dependency

GitHub Copilot Agent automatically checks licenses when adding dependencies. However, if you're evaluating a dependency:

1. **Check its license**: Run `make license-check` after adding the dependency
2. **Review the report**: Run `make license-report` to generate a CSV of all licenses
3. **If unsure**: Ask in your PR - maintainers will help evaluate edge cases

### License Checking

The project includes automated license compliance checking:

- **CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/license-check.yml` runs on every PR that changes `go.mod`
- **Local Check**: Run `make license-check` to verify all dependencies (installs `go-licenses` on-demand)
- **License Report**: Run `make license-report` to see detailed license information

All dependencies are automatically scanned using Google's `go-licenses` tool in CI, which classifies licenses by type and identifies potential compliance issues. Note that `go-licenses` is not actively maintained, so we install it on-demand rather than as a regular build dependency.

## 🤖 Automated Dependency Updates (Dependabot)

This project uses GitHub Dependabot to automatically keep dependencies up-to-date with weekly security patches and version updates.

### What Dependabot Monitors

Dependabot is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml` to monitor:

1. **Go modules** (`/go.mod`) - Weekly updates for Go dependencies
2. **npm packages** - Weekly updates for:
   - Documentation site (`/docs/package.json`)
   - GitHub Actions setup scripts (`/actions/setup/js/package.json`)
   - Workflow dependencies (`/.github/workflows/package.json`)
3. **Python packages** (`/.github/workflows/requirements.txt`) - Weekly updates for workflow scripts

### Expected Behavior

- **Schedule**: Dependabot checks for updates **every Monday** (weekly interval)
- **Pull Requests**: Creates automated PRs from `dependabot[bot]` for:
  - Security vulnerabilities (immediate)
  - Version updates (weekly batch)
- **Limit**: Maximum of 10 open PRs per ecosystem to prevent overwhelming maintainers

### What to Expect from Dependabot PRs

Dependabot PRs will:
- Have clear titles like "Bump lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21 in /docs"
- Include changelog links and release notes
- Show compatibility score based on semantic versioning
- Automatically rebase when the base branch changes

### Troubleshooting Dependabot

If Dependabot stops creating PRs:

1. **Check repository settings**: Go to Settings → Security → Dependabot
   - Ensure "Dependabot alerts" is enabled
   - Ensure "Dependabot security updates" is enabled
   - Ensure "Dependabot version updates" is enabled

2. **Verify configuration**: Check `.github/dependabot.yml` syntax
   - Directory paths must match locations of dependency files
   - Ecosystem names must be exact: `gomod`, `npm`, `pip`

3. **Check for rate limits**: Dependabot may be rate-limited if there are too many updates

4. **Manual trigger**: You can manually trigger Dependabot from repository Settings → Security → Dependabot

### CI Configuration and Go Module Proxy

Our CI workflows are configured to prevent Go module download failures by using explicit proxy settings. All GitHub Actions workflows that use Go include the following environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  # Configure Go module proxy with fallback to direct download
  # This prevents 403 Forbidden errors from proxy.golang.org
  GOPROXY: https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  # Ensure no public modules are treated as private
  GOPRIVATE: ""
  GONOPROXY: ""
  GOSUMDB: sum.golang.org
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Prevents 403 Forbidden errors**: If `proxy.golang.org` is temporarily unavailable or blocks requests, Go will fall back to direct downloads
- **Ensures public modules are accessible**: Empty `GOPRIVATE` and `GONOPROXY` settings prevent public modules from being treated as private
- **Maintains checksum verification**: `GOSUMDB` ensures module integrity through the Go checksum database

**Affected workflows:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (test and integration jobs)
- `.github/workflows/integration-agentics.yml`
- `.github/workflows/format-and-commit.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (gosec and govulncheck jobs)
- `.github/workflows/license-check.yml`

**Troubleshooting module download failures:**

If you encounter `403 Forbidden` errors from Go module proxy:

1. **Check environment variables**: Verify `GOPROXY`, `GOPRIVATE`, `GONOPROXY`, and `GOSUMDB` are set correctly
2. **Test proxy connectivity**: Run `go list -m golang.org/x/sys@latest` to verify access
3. **Use direct fallback**: If the proxy is blocked, the `,direct` suffix in `GOPROXY` enables direct downloads from source repositories
4. **Check runner logs**: Look for proxy connectivity verification in the "Verify Go environment and module access" step

For more details on the incident that led to these improvements, see issue #12894 (CI run #32917).

### Handling Dependabot PRs

When reviewing Dependabot PRs:

1. **Review the changes**: Check the changelog and compatibility score
2. **Let CI run**: Wait for all GitHub Actions checks to pass
3. **Test if needed**: For major version updates, test locally or let the agent verify
4. **Merge quickly**: Security updates should be merged as soon as CI passes
5. **Batch updates**: For minor version updates, you can merge multiple PRs at once

### Security Patches

Dependabot prioritizes security patches:
- Security vulnerabilities are updated **immediately** (not weekly)
- PRs are tagged with severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
- Security PRs should be reviewed and merged within 24-48 hours

## 🧪 Testing

For comprehensive testing guidelines including assert vs require usage, table-driven test patterns, and best practices, see **[scratchpad/testing.md](scratchpad/testing.md)**.

Quick reference:
- `make test-unit` - Fast unit tests (~25s)
- `make test` - Full test suite (~30s)
- `make agent-finish` - Complete validation before committing

## 🎯 Why No Local Development?

This project is built using agentic workflows to demonstrate their capabilities:

- **Dogfooding**: We use our own tools to build our tools
- **Accessibility**: No need for complex local setup
- **Consistency**: All changes go through the same automated process
- **Best practices**: Agents follow guidelines automatically
- **Focus on outcomes**: Describe what you want, not how to build it

The [Development Guide](DEVGUIDE.md) exists as reference for the agent, not for local setup.
